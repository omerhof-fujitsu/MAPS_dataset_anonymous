    "problem": "Maria ha tre mele identiche e tre arance identiche. In quanti modi può distribuire la frutta tra i suoi quattro amici se non dà alcuna arancia a Jacky? (Nota: Maria non prende frutta per sé, e alcuni dei suoi amici potrebbero non riceverne affatto.)",
    "solution": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",
