    "solution": "Notice that $3^{17} + 3^{10} = 3^{10} \\cdot (3^7 + 1)$; thus $9$ divides into $3^{17} + 3^{10}$. Furthermore, using the sum of seventh powers factorization, it follows that $3+1 = 4$ divides into $3^7 + 1$.\n\nUsing the divisibility criterion for $4$, we know that $\\overline{AB}$ must be divisible by $4$. Thus $B$ is even and not divisible by $3$. Also, $A$ is odd, so $\\overline{AB} = 10A + B$, where $4$ does not divide into $10A$. Thus, $4$ cannot divide into $B$ either, otherwise $10A + B$ would not be divisible by $4$. Then, $B$ must be equal to $2$.\n\nUsing the divisibility criterion for $9$, it follows that $3(A+B+C)$ is divisible by $9$, that is $3$ divides into $A+C+2$. Thus, $A+C = 4,7,10,13,16 \\quad (*)$. Using the divisibility criterion for $11$, since \\begin{align*}10^{8} \\cdot A + 10^7 \\cdot B + \\cdots + B &\\equiv (-1)^8 \\cdot A + (-1)^7 \\cdot B + \\cdots + B \\\\ &\\equiv A - B + \\cdots + B \\\\ &\\equiv -1 \\pmod{11},\\end{align*}then the alternating sum of digits, which works out to be $B+C-A \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $2+C-A$ is either equal to $10$ or $-1$, so $A-C = 3,-8$.\n\nIn the former case when $A-C = 3$, summing with $(*)$ yields that $2A \\in \\{7,10,13,16,19\\}$, of which only $A = 5$ fit the problem conditions. This yields that $C = 2$. However, we know that $B$ and $C$ are distinct, so we can eliminate this possibility. Thus, $A-C = -8$, of which only $C = 9, A = 1$ works. The answer is $\\boxed{129}$.",
