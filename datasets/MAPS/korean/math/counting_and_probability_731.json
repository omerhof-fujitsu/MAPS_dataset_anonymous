    "solution": "The original rectangle may be subdivided into four smaller congruent rectangles, all sharing $O$ as a vertex. Each of these rectangles is analogous, so we can consider our random point $P$ to be without loss of generality in the smaller rectangle with $A$ as a vertex. All points in this smaller rectangle are closer to $A$ than they are to $B$, $C$, or $D$, so we just need to determine the probability that $OP<AP$. [asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,100)--(-250,100)--(-250,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-250,100),NW); label(\"$O$\",(0,0),SE);\ndraw((-105,100)--(-145,0));\nfill((-105,100)--(-145,0)--(0,0)--(0,100)--cycle, gray(.7));\n[/asy] Since a $180^\\circ$ rotation about the center of the smaller rectangle takes $O$ to $A$, it takes the shaded region to the unshaded region. Therefore, exactly half the area is shaded, and the overall probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$, independent of $k$.",
