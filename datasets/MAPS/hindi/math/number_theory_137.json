    "problem": "100 वस्तुओं के सत्य-असत्य परीक्षण में, 4 का गुणक वाला प्रत्येक प्रश्न सत्य है, तथा अन्य सभी असत्य हैं। यदि कोई छात्र 3 का गुणक वाला प्रत्येक प्रश्न असत्य तथा अन्य सभी सत्य चिह्नित करता है, तो 100 वस्तुओं में से कितने प्रश्नों के उत्तर सही होंगे?",
    "solution": "The student will answer a question correctly if\n\nCase 1: both the student and the answer key say it is true. This happens when the answer is NOT a multiple of 3 but IS a multiple of 4.\n\nCase 2. both the student and the answer key say it is false. This happens when the answer IS a multiple of 3 but is NOT a multiple of 4.\n\nSince the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, the divisibility of numbers (in our case, correctness of answers) will repeat in cycles of 12. In the first 12 integers, $4$ and $8$ satisfy Case 1 and $3,6,$ and $9$ satisfy Case 2, so for every group of 12, the student will get 5 right answers. Since there are 8 full groups of 12 in 100, the student will answer at least $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$ questions correctly. However, remember that we must also consider the leftover numbers 97, 98, 99, 100 and out of these, $99$ and $100$ satisfy one of the cases. So our final number of correct answers is $40 + 2 = \\boxed{42}$.",
