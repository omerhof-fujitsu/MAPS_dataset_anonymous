    "problem": "Tres parejas van al cine. Quieren sentarse juntas para disfrutar al máximo, pero en su lugar se sientan al azar en una fila de seis asientos. ¿Cuál es la probabilidad de que se sienten en una configuración socialmente óptima, en la que cada persona esté sentada junto a su pareja?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick people to fill the first two seats, and 3 ways for those two people to be a couple, for a probability $3/15 = 1/5$ that the first two seats are a couple. If a couple is seated successfully, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to seat people in the next two seats, and 2 ways for those two people to be a couple (you could pick either of the two remaining couples), for a probability $2/6 = 1/3$ that those two seats are a couple. If the first two couples are seated successfully, the last two seats will be guaranteed to go to the last couple. So, the probability that everything goes right is $1/5 \\cdot 1/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$.",
