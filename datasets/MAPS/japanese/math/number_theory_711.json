    "solution": "Since the GCD of $m$ and $n$ is 8, $m = 8x$ and $n = 8y$ for some integers $x$ and $y$.  Note that minimizing $m + n = 8x + 8y = 8(x + y)$ is equivalent to minimizing $x + y$.\n\nThe LCM of $m$ and $n$ is $112 = 2^4 \\cdot 7 = 8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7$, so one of $x$ and $y$ is divisible by 2 and one is divisible by 7.  Then we can minimize $x + y$ by setting $x$ and $y$ to be 2 and 7 in some order.  Therefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $8(2 + 7) = \\boxed{72}$.",
